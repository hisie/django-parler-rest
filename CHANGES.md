## Changes in version 1.4.2 (2016-06-17)

* Added type checking on the models used in the serializer.
  This avoids nasty errors when the shared model is used accidently.

For example, in Django 1.7 `MyModel.translations.related.model` resolved the translated model,
but on Django 1.8+ it returns the parent model. `MyModel.translations.related.related_model`
should be used instead.


## Changes in version 1.4.1 (2016-06-02)

* Make sure the model's `save_translations()` and `save_translation()` methods are called,
  in case those are overridden to provide extra changes.


## Changes in version 1.4 (2016-05-04)

* Added `languages` context variable to `TranslatedSerializer`.


## Changes in version 1.3 (2015-12-16)
